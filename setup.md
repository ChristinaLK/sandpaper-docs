title: Setup
---

The {sandpaper} template requires [R] and [pandoc] to be installed, both of 
which are bundled in the [RStudio] IDE. 

## Foundational software

There are three programs that the template works with: Git, RStudio, and pandoc.
They can be installed from the following resources:

 - **Git** https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/#git
 - **R** https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/#r
 - **pandoc** we recommend installing this by [installing the RStudio IDE][RStudio]

::::: solution

### What if I don't want to use RStudio?

That's perfectly okay! If you do not want to use RStudio, you can install pandoc
directly to your computer by following the directions on https://pandoc.org/installing.html.
We recommend using RStudio because it is tightly integrated with pandoc.

::::::::: prereq

### Setting up your R workspace

When you set up R, it's important to make sure you set it up to never save your
workspace on exit and never load a previously saved workspace on startup. 

#### Via RStudio 

If you are using RStudio, you can [follow the instructions in this forum 
post](https://community.rstudio.com/t/first-line-of-every-r-script/799/12?u=zkamvar):

1. From the menu, select <cmd>Tools<cmd> > <cmd>Global Options</cmd>
2. Under **Workspace Options**, de-select "Restore .RData into workspace at startup" and set "Save workspace to .RData on exit" to "Never"

#### Via Command Line Interface

The flags `--no-restore` and `--no-save` will set these defaults, so you can 
create an alias for BASH:

```bash
alias R='R --no-restore --no-save'
```

### There are many ways to set up R to work with the lesson template

For example, Zhian Kamvar uses Vim with the NVim-R plugin and 
[radian](https://github.com/randy3k/radian#readme). There is no one right way!

## Lesson Template Modules (R packages)

The template is divided into three R pakages, which are designed to be modular
and upgradable on the fly. Because these are still in developement, please use
the following to install (*and update*) the packages:

First, **open R/RStudio** and then follow the instructions based on your
operating system:

::::::::::: solution

### MacOS/Windows

```r
# register the repositories for The Carpentries and CRAN
options(repos = c(
  carpentries = "https://carpentries.github.io/drat/",
  CRAN = "https://cran.rstudio.com/"
))

# Install the template packages to your R library
install.packages(c("sandpaper", "varnish", "pegboard"))
```

::::::::::::::::::::


::::::::::: solution

### Linux

Note: we are using the RStudio package manager. This is set up for Ubuntu 20.04,

:::: callout

### What if I have a different version of Linux?

If you have a different version of linux, you can visit https://packagemanager.rstudio.com/client/#/repos/1/overview, 
select your system where it says "Use this URL to work with the latest binary
packages for Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal) **change**", and replace the packagemanager
URL below.

::::

```r
options(repos = c(
  carpentries = "https://carpentries.github.io/drat/",
  CRAN = "https://packagemanager.rstudio.com/all/__linux__/focal/latest"
))

install.packages(c("sandpaper", "varnish", "pegboard"))
```
